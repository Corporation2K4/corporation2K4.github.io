                    **EDITOR'S NOTE:** This article explores the historical and ideological journey of the kibbutz, examining its profound impact on the formation of the State of Israel and its subsequent evolution in the face of modern challenges.
                </div>

               
                <p> ust as today’s VIP visitors to Israel are taken
to see the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum,
so in the first decades of statehood were they
ushered off to a kibbutz, especially if they were
situated on the left side of the political spectrum. In
1972, for instance, at a time when many New Leftists had come to regard Israel as a present-day Sparta constantly brandishing its sword, the crowned
prophet of the student revolution, Herbert Marcuse,
visited Israel for the first time. His hosts took him
to Kibbutz Hulda, where he was shown around by
Amos Oz, who later gratefully quoted him as saying: “Yours is the only socialist experiment that has
not spilt blood and so far has not turned bourgeois.”
Overseas visitors lent the kibbutz movement
the endorsement it so desperately craved. Nobody
else on the Israeli scene seems to have been quite
so much in need of constant confirmation from society at large or quite so sensitive to criticism. This
vulnerability stemmed from the fact that kibbutz
members, even in the 1960s and 1970s, were not
content to live a life of pleasant, everyday routine.
Since the first decade of the century, they had struggled to bring into existence an altogether new type
of society, one that would both establish real equality and imbue ordinary life with special significance.
At a time when the descent of the Soviet experiment
into the worst sort of tyranny had made the utopian
idea appear bankrupt, their achievements continued to hold out the hope that a radical social transformation was within the realm of possibility. But
while the kibbutz managed for a long time to present an alternative lifestyle to idealistic young people,
it did so with increasing difficulty and growing selfdoubt. Indeed, from the day the State of Israel was
born in 1948, a sense of crisis was the kibbutz’s constant companion.
A century after the creation of the first kibbutz,
more than sixty years since the establishment of
the State of Israel, and nearly forty years since Marcuse’s visit to Hulda, the kibbutz movement still
has question marks hanging over it. To what extent
has its heroic attempt to create a small-scale utopia
through education and socialization stood the test
of reality? Can one still say of the kibbutz, as Martin
Buber once did, that it is an “experiment that didn’t
fail”? To address these questions, one must first take
a close look at the impact of larger political and
social developments on the kibbutz from 1948 to
the present.

T

he War of Independence took a heavy toll on
the kibbutz movement: the destruction of settlements, the loss of hundreds of its sons, the hundreds of fresh widows. In the words of Kadish Luz,
a member of Kibbutz Deganya Bet and a leader of
the Histadrut labor federation, children were “broken up into two categories: those with fathers and
those without.” There was, as he put it, a sense of
“mission fatigue.” The strain of mobilizing to es-

tablish a state, a luminous ideal that had justified
so many hardships, had been relieved. A state now
existed—and not every day could be as thrilling
as November 29, 1947, when the UN had voted in
favor of partition. The disappointments that followed were, perhaps, inevitable.
During the period of the British Mandate, the
kibbutz had always been the standard-bearer, ready
to establish “tower and stockade” footholds in dangerously exposed territory or to volunteer for whatever else needed to be done. After the attainment
of independence in 1948, however, the pioneering
tasks it had performed in the past were now assumed by the state. Settlement of the land was managed by the government and implemented not by
self-sacrificing kibbutz youth groups, but by new
immigrants summarily dispatched to frontier regions. Many new kibbutzim were still being set up
along the borders, but they were no longer alone.
Immigration ceased to be a clandestine operation
conducted by kibbutz volunteers and became one
of the state’s responsibilities. Instead of volunteering
for the underground, there was now conscription
into the IDF. Kibbutz members, more than other
citizens, volunteered for elite units, flight squads,
and the commandos—a price tag of blood held up

the hour for pioneering has passed,” he declared.
“Without a robust pioneering drive to match the
needs and possibilities that have increased and intensified with statehood—we will not manage the
three great tasks of our generation: ingathering the
exiles, making the desert bloom, and security.” But
this was reassuring rhetoric: the tasks were on a
scale far beyond the means of the kibbutz movement, which could do little but watch as the state
usurped its historical role.
The deepest cause for despondency was the fact
that despite the massive flow of immigrants into the
Jewish state during its first four years, the kibbutz
suffered from dwindling numbers: some members left, no new ones came. The Holocaust had
destroyed the human reservoirs that might have
replenished the kibbutzim. On the whole, the postIndependence immigrants lacked the ideological
education dispensed by kibbutz youth goups, whose
graduates themselves had only rarely remained on
the kibbutz. What is more, most of the newcomers
were older and hailed from traditional societies in
Muslim countries. They wished to preserve their
family framework and had no inclination to adopt a
communal lifestyle.
The new immigrants did not understand social-

by members or outside supporters in the face of any
criticism flung at the kibbutz. But the army too was,
of course, run by the state.
Fully aware of what was happening, David
Ben-Gurion, despite his statist orientation, strove
to lift the kibbutz movement out of its doldrums:
“There is no more harmful or dangerous assumption than that with the establishment of the state,

ist aspirations; their Zionist consciousness did not
embrace such concepts as enlisting for national endeavors, subordinating individual interests to those
of the public, or other keystones of a voluntarist and
public-spirited worldview. The kibbutz’s culture of
direct democracy was alien to most of them, to say
nothing of voluntary self-subordination to communal life. They regarded the kibbutz as a bastion of

uncompromising secularism hostile to tradition,
an institution that dissolved the traditional family,
and an ideology that opposed the principle of private property. In addition to everything else, they
found it degrading that they were expected to work
as manual laborers. It is difficult to imagine how this
wave of immigrants could have been integrated into
the kibbutz, even if much more energy had been invested in doing so.
Yet Ben-Gurion demanded that the kibbutzim
throw open their gates. “What have the pioneers
done for three hundred thousand new immigrants?” he railed in the Knesset in January 1950.
“During the past two years I have been humiliated
and shamed by the pioneering movement’s failure:
the greatest thing that has ever happened in its history has taken place, the exodus from Egypt has
begun, the ingathering of the exiles has begun, and
what have our pioneers done? Have the kibbutzim
put themselves to the task?” Ben-Gurion argued
that the principle of self-labor (no hired hands)
had once been an appropriate barrier against employing Arab workers at a time when it was necessary to get “Hebrew labor” off the ground. But the
new realities of the state required that immigrants
be absorbed into the productive organs of the kibbutz and given jobs. This, in his eyes, was now the
true pioneering. The kibbutz movement, including
members of his own party who supported his immigration policy, rejected his demand because it
militated against two basic tenets of kibbutz doctrine: equality and communality. “Hired labor in
the kibbutz economy,” insisted Shlomo Rozen, the
secretary-general of the Kibbutz Artzi Federation,
“means the destruction of the kibbutz economy,
with its social and its Zionist-class values.” The
kibbutz could not have absorbed thousands of
hired hands and still remained a kibbutz.

T

he establishment of the state exposed the duality of socialist and Zionist components that
had defined the kibbutz movement from its inception. The kibbutz was to have been the model
of the society of the future, a just and egalitarian
society even as it shouldered its special responsibilities and missions in the realization of Zionism.
But while “national and pioneering tasks were the
chief substance of kibbutz life in the period preceding the state’s establishment,” as Haim Gvati,
one of the founders of Kibbutz Gvat in the 1920s,
put it, they were not always of equal significance.
Shlomo Ne’eman, another veteran kibbutznik, distinguished between a “national matter” and “social
goals” in terms of the energy people were prepared
to invest in each of them: “There is no limit to the
efforts people devote to a national matter. Nowhere
does one find such dedication to social goals.” In
the pre-state period, the Zionist deed was performed by kibbutzim. In fact, Ne’eman claimed,
the history of the kibbutz “as a way of life and the
kernel of the society of the future” began only after
the establishment of the state. Having been displaced from the vanguard of Zionism, and having
seen its national functions greatly diminished, the
kibbutz had to shift its main focus to the mission
of social reconstruction. But there was a problem:
what was to fuel the shift? As Ne’eman observed, it
is easier to mobilize people for dramatic national
tasks than for mundane social ones. A few idealistic youths plunged into the development towns to

live with and assist the new immigrants, but they
constituted a distinct minority. The vast majority
of kibbutz youth was not fired by the idea. Just as
Ben-Gurion’s call to embark on pioneering tasks,
such as settling the Negev, evoked little response,
so too did the attempt to have the kibbutz negotiate a 180-degree turn to focus on being a model of
a utopian, egalitarian society. The prospect did not
stir the imagination or generate enthusiasm. As if
to convince themselves that they had not lost the
luster earned by carrying the Jewish people on their
shoulders, movement leaders kept enumerating the
kibbutz’s accomplishments: settling on the country’s borders; making the desert bloom; developing modern, viable, and advanced agriculture; and

social revolution, or as a prototype for that society.
In both cases, the relationship between the kibbutz
and its surroundings vitally informed every vision:
whether the kibbutz advanced revolution or set an
example, there was a symbiosis between the kibbutz and the larger society. But by the late 1950s,
Kadish Luz, by then Minister of Agriculture and
a symbol of integrity and modesty, could protest
that “our main difficulty today is that the very way
of life and the need for it in the eyes of the broad
public outside the kibbutz is problematic, and this
attitude has filtered down to kibbutz members
themselves.” New definitions of the state’s needs,
tasks, and aims replaced the tasks traditionally
undertaken by the kibbutz. Careers in science, the

the volunteer service of their young people in elite
IDF units. The anxiety that the kibbutz movement
was losing its central place in Israeli society gnawed
away at her devoted members and supporters in the
1950s and 1960s.
The centrality of the kibbutz in the pre-state period and the subsequent decline in its status were
reflected in Hebrew culture. When Hannah Senesh
composed her poem “My God, May it Never End”
not long before she parachuted to her death in 1944
in a doomed rescue mission behind Nazi lines in
Hungary, she was evoking memories of the Mediterranean coast near Kibbutz Sdot Yam, where she
lived. S. Yizhar’s first story, “Ephraim Returns to the
Alfalfa,” is set on a kibbutz. The first novels of the
most important post-Independence writers are also
set on kibbutzim. Naomi Shemer, who famously
wrote the lyrics for “Jerusalem of Gold” in 1967,
had, in her early years, sung of the eucalyptus grove
at Kibbutz Kinneret, her birthplace. Moshe Dayan’s
eulogy for Ro’i Rothberg, a victim of terrorism at
Kibbutz Nachal Oz on the edge of the Gaza Strip,
symbolized the central place of farmer-soldier units
and frontier kibbutzim in the public consciousness
of the 1950s.

B

ut this was not to last. Since the 1960s, city life
has replaced the kibbutz as the main scene of action in Hebrew literature. When the kibbutz features
in a work such as Yehoshua Knaz’s novel Infiltration
(1986), it is meant to represent the domination—unto
death—of the individual by society. This had been
an important theme of kibbutz literature since David
Maletz’s pioneering novel, Circles, which appeared in
the early 1940s, but by the 1980s, it dominated the
scene. The kibbutz became the symbol of the misery
that Zionism inflicted on those who had followed it
to the utopian wilderness. Thus, for example, the institution of children’s dormitories became a topic of
incessant discussion in Israeli culture, as if an unhappy childhood were the sole preserve of kibbutz
society. It is difficult to find novels in which the kibbutz plays a major role in the past few decades. Asaf
Inbari’s recent book, Homeward, about the history
of Kibbutz Afikim, where he was born in 1968, reads
like a requiem.
In this bygone world, people had often asked
whether the kibbutz ought to serve as an avantgarde, charged with guiding Israeli society towards

military, or service in the top tiers of the state apparatus were now considered no less important than
being a kibbutz member. The kibbutz still enjoyed
symbolic prestige; it was still a destination of foreign VIPs. But the milieu was changing. Minister
of Education and kibbutz member Aharon Yadlin
observed that the kibbutz had lost its supremacy in
Israeli public consciousness and that people now
saw “the kibbutz member as strange and eccentric,
and his creation [the kibbutz] as anachronistic.”

T

he kibbutz was never meant to be a sect. Its
connection to the broader Zionist movement
was vital to its self-image. But how could it avoid
being marginalized when Israeli society as a whole
relinquished the pioneering ideals of the early days
and came to resemble the western bourgeois world?
The process was stealthy: slowly, almost imperceptibly, Israeli society changed colors. The evaporation of social idealism in the general society caused
the kibbutz to regard itself, in the best case, as an
oasis and, in the worst, as an anachronism. In this
atmosphere, the kibbutz was destined to shrink:
there would always be drop-outs, but it was doubtful that there would be newcomers.
After the War of Independence, kibbutz members had sought to improve their standard of living,
not with luxuries (heaven forbid) but with simple
commodities: reasonable living quarters with indoor bathrooms so as to dispense with communal
showers and sprinting to WCs in the rain; some
furniture for the private living quarters; and more
freedom in spending the personal funds allotted
to them. As families grew larger, members sought
housing that would enable them to host their dormitory-dwelling children in the afternoon. The
demands were modest, not exceeding the accommodations of a worker’s family in town. This particular comparative measure was critical both existentially and ideologically. Too large a gap would
have caused people to leave the kibbutz and move
to town. And the kibbutz had always contended
that communal life was not only more just and
equitable, but also more efficient economically. In
1949, Joseph Sprinzak, a veteran labor-Zionist politician and the first speaker of the Knesset, but himself a city-dweller, sought to define sympathetically
the outlook of the kibbutz’s new standard-bearers:
they are “capable of supreme self-sacrifice at any

moment but not prepared for the ascetic self-denial
of monks or hermits.”
“Is it inevitable that the accumulation of property
will lower the temperature of the vision?” demanded a kibbutz member. “Can only people without
means and without professions create a communal
society?” That is, can a commune be sustained only
at a low standard of living? And is it destined to pass
from the world with the onset of economic prosperity? Sixty years later, this question sounds prophetic.
The rise in living standards was accompanied
by a shift in the balance between the individual and
the kibbutz. More and more, members sought some
privacy within the communal framework. Electric
kettles showed up first in family apartments, then
record players, radios, and refrigerators. The kibbutz’s common domain also grew steadily weaker:
with the advent of television, participation in kibbutz assemblies fell. The children’s dormitories
fought a losing battle. As a result, family members
gathered together to eat in private homes instead of
in the communal dining room. The home became
a focus of identity. The bond to the kibbutz was no
longer preserved by ideology, which had collapsed,
but by inertia and a sense of belonging to place and
family.
The kibbutz had to respond to its members’ intellectual ambitions and cultural aspirations as well.
Young people’s paths to the university could no longer be blocked and they had to be allowed to study
whatever they wanted. The slogan of “self-realization” (through living on the kibbutz) was replaced
by “personal growth.” Individualism eroded group
commitment. Old-timers felt the kibbutz slipping
away from them. “We are witness to a shift in emphasis,” complained one veteran in 1970, “from kibbutz to economy, from vision to interests, from allembracing moral standards to criteria of efficiency.”
Members of the kibbutz’s third generation did not
accept their parents’ doctrines, and demanded the
freedom to shape their own lives. “We see nothing
wrong with the development of kibbutz careerism,”
a younger member declared. So as not to lag behind
the rest of the country, the kibbutz industrialized.
This facilitated a higher standard of living and, just
as importantly, provided an entire stratum of young
people with challenging, interesting work in industrial plants where instead of picking oranges they
could design and develop new plastic products or
precision metal parts. Agriculture lost its primacy as
the main branch of the kibbutz movement. A whole
way of rural community life, bound up with the
celebration of nature holidays and the education of
youth towards manual labor, lost its bearings.

I

n November and December of 1971, the journalist Ya’ir Kotler published a series of articles
entitled “The Kibbutz in the Era of Affluence” in
Ha’aretz. He portrayed the kibbutz as wealthy,
not truly egalitarian, petty bourgeois, disappointing to young and old, frustrating to those working
for the members’ general good, imprisoned in the
rhetoric of the past, and devoid of new horizons.
The letters-to-the-editor columns of Ha’aretz and
other newspapers were soon full of complaints and
protestations: “Let’s see if you come close to living
by the criteria you demand of the kibbutz.” “Look
how much we give to the state, and the esteem in
which the world holds us.” But there were also more
balanced responses. One kibbutz member wrote

that, contrary to what some people may think, “the
kibbutz is not a ‘nature reserve’, but an integral
part of Israeli society” despite all of its problems.
“Three and a half percent of the population cannot
long withstand the general current of society.” No
less than Kotler’s original articles, this statement
pointed to an inherent paradox: to the extent that
the kibbutz strove to reflect innovative trends in
the economy and society, and sought to satisfy the
third generation’s more individualistic ambitions,
it moved away from its idealistic-pioneering image
and lost its standing in Israeli society. The pioneering-national message melted away with the attainment of statehood.
The growth and consolidation of the kibbutz
movement took place in the 1920s when the Jewish community in Palestine was pervaded by an al-

ment from exploitation to justice, a bold endeavor
to refashion man and society. Different parts of the
kibbutz movement lost their “Red fascination” at
different times. The last ones sobered up after the
USSR’s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, but in
the following decades, too, the USSR continued to
serve as a yardstick for comparison. By the end of
the 1980s, however, it was finally clear to everyone
that the Russian experiment had failed in human,
social, and political terms.
Even earlier, however, toward the end of 1960s,
some young kibbutzniks had begun to look in
an entirely different direction for inspiration.
Members of the second and third generations of
kibbutzniks began to explore traditional Jewish
sources. At the center of this phenomenon was the
journal Shdemot, which served as a platform for

most messianic pathos, by hopes of revamping the
world here and now. These hopes were connected
with events in Russia—the country of origin of many
kibbutz members and the guiding light of socialist
actualization to which all lifted their eyes. This was of
course an illusion, ending in one of the greatest disappointments in human history. But as long as the
USSR sun still seemed to shine, the kibbutz in Palestine had a model against which to measure itself.
Even those who were repelled by Soviet brutality were, to some extent, reassured by the very existence of that huge state where a large-scale experiment was under way to put socialism into practice.
They were fascinated by what they saw as a move-

young people disillusioned with socialism, fed up
with the spiritual emptiness of the kibbutz’s affluent society, and searching for God. Yearning for
spiritual content and elevation, these people called
for traditional holiday celebrations instead of the
new rituals invented by earlier generations of kibbutzniks. They and others like them spurned the
kibbutz Haggadah, which reflected contemporary
culture and sometimes current events, in favor of
a Haggadah to which God had been restored and
which became increasingly similar to the traditional one. All of the wonderful quasi-biblical ceremonies devised by creative artists and teachers in
the heyday of the kibbutz to express the new ex-

perience of a village culture were now judged in
terms of their fidelity to Jewish tradition. The ushering in of the Sabbath, including candle lighting,
gathered momentum. The long-neglected holiday
of Yom Kippur came back into the picture. The
socialist bookshelf made way for the Jewish one.
Kibbutz members took to studying Judaism at yeshivas or universities. All of this was a reaction to
the exile of the Divine Presence from the kibbutz,
as the poet Abba Kovner put it, an attempt to compensate for the death of the socialist utopia.
This new approach to Judaism was a component

sult, and pain of societal rejection. The egalitarian
standard-bearers found themselves at the center of
a class and ethnic confrontation.
Several months after the 1981 elections, Israeli
television broadcast a program including a segment in which a member of Kibbutz Manara on the
Lebanon border was seen swimming to his heart’s
content in the kibbutz pool. Menachem Begin, in
an interview on Israel Radio on the eve of Rosh
ha-Shanah, referred to this by then notorious kibbutznik and the pool as an arrogant expression of
a culture of excess: “That man on a kibbutz, loung-

of kibbutz culture that radiated outwardly to secular Israeli society. It awakened an interest in Judaism among many young people seeking an escape
from the cold, modern world. Ironically enough,
however, within the kibbutz itself it was a different story. Most people were not interested in such
things. The intelligentsia, the spiritual elite who had
established the Efal Seminar, Oranim College, and
the Kibbutzim College of Education, and who had
studied “impractical” subjects such as history and
Jewish philosophy, felt uneasy and frustrated with
the ideological atrophy of the kibbutz. The economic managers, the active group that ran the industries
supporting the kibbutz, were hardly thrilled by the
steady growth of expenditure on education and
higher studies not geared to kibbutz needs. Very
likely, they felt that they were financing “idlers.”
Most kibbutz members sat on the sidelines, preferring to stay home and watch television rather than
participate in discussions on the meaning of life on
the kibbutz.

T

he kibbutz’s status as a leading actor in Israeli
society continued to decline through the early
1980s. It still played an important part in settlement
and the IDF, and it still exhibited impressive economic viability. But gone were the days when kibbutz members featured prominently in the Knesset
or the government. They did no find their place in
the leadership of the Labor movement, much less
act as catalysts in Israeli politics. The earthshaking
victory of the Right in 1977 had turned their world
upside down. But apart from bestirring themselves
to campaign for the Labor Party in the following
elections, they did not shake off their lethargy.
It was as if the flame that had once burned in the
hearts of their fathers had completely died out with
the changing of the generational guard.
The kibbutz’s supposed “Garden of Eden” had
for some years harbored a snake: the metal-working, woodworking, electronics, and plastics industries established in the 1970s had revitalized the kibbutzim economically, but they rested on hired labor.
The workers hailed from development towns, the
managers from kibbutzim. This meant that there
were now two opposing classes: employers, who devoutly upheld equality at home, but whose factories
did not promote workers to management positions;
and the children of those same Eastern Jews, who
had been uninterested in joining the kibbutzim and
grew up in development towns, like Kiryat Shmona,
Yerucham, and Beit Shemesh, on the bitterness, in-

ing in the pool as if [you were watching] … some
American millionaire and talking with a good deal
of condescension? Did I sit at that swimming pool?
I have no such luxury.” Begin’s crude and demagogic
use of the “ethnic card” reflected his awareness that
the kibbutz, for all its faults and weaknesses, still
posed an alternative to his new regime. Moreover, it
still symbolized an idealistic society, the best of the
Israeli nation. If Begin wished to rewrite the history
of Israel and give voice to groups like his own Irgun,
which had been excluded from the Zionist narrative, he had to undermine the symbolic keystone of
the Labor movement—the kibbutz—by depicting
its members as people living off the fat of the land
while they exploited hired workers and denied these
workers’ children admission into kibbutz schools.
The Prime Minister’s words created a media
storm. The kibbutzim had some passionate defenders. “You obliterate the kibbutzim, you obliterate
Israeli identity,” wrote the journalist and novelist
Amos Keinan. “The kibbutz does not belong only
to the kibbutz, only to the Labor movement, but is
an asset to all Israel, to the Jewish people as a whole,
and one of the wonderful expressions of Jewish genius.” Other leading journalists and writers rushed
to the kibbutz’s rescue and Begin was quick to apologize, though he termed the torrent of retorts condemning him “hysteria.” Nonetheless, the damage
had been done. In vain did kibbutz economists pull
out numbers to show that they did not enjoy economic privileges. In vain did they list all the things
kibbutz members had done on behalf of development towns. In vain did they explain that it was every kibbutz, not every kibbutz member, that had a
swimming pool. The image of the rich, patronizing
Ashkenazi kibbutznik was fixed in Israel’s internal
discourse on Eastern Jews.
Kibbutz members were deeply pained by this
campaign of delegitimization. Where had they
erred, they asked themselves. Could things have
been done differently? If so, how? Martin Buber’s
famous definition of the kibbutz as an experiment
that had not failed was repeated again and again, as
if it were a magical formula with restorative powers.
Certainly, the kibbutz did not quite fail—as a way of
life it continued to be a symbol and an example to
emulate. But neither did the excitement of the prestate period return, except perhaps in wartime or on
kibbutzim facing security dangers. In normal times
and on calm kibbutzim, it was life in town that appeared interesting, innovative, and challenging.
Ironically enough, it was the economic collapse

of considerable parts of the kibbutz movement in
the late 1980s that disrupted this drab state of affairs. Affluence proved to have been temporary,
perhaps even illusory. Yet a return to austerity and
“making do with little” was not an option in late
20th-century Israel. The principles of egalitarianism
and communalism were sacrificed on the altar of
economic efficiency. The collapse of the USSR resonated powerfully: economics had defeated ideology,
and the expert in social organization replaced the
charismatic leader. The aspiration to reshape the
world was replaced by a far more modest concern:
to ensure a dignified old age, at least, for the generation that had given its all for the kibbutz.
Was the collapse of the kibbutz the result of poor
management or did it point to the system’s essential
failings? Socialist ideologue Yitzhak Ben-Aharon
believed to the end of his century-long life that in
Israel, as in the USSR, the failure had not been inevitable, but rather the result of the incorrect application of correct principles. Since a large part of the
kibbutz movement still believes in communal life
and egalitarianism, and even succeeds economically, this assumption cannot be dismissed out of
hand. At the same time, the inherent contradictions
of raising a managerial class on the kibbutz were
not merely accidental. The kibbutz spurned the idea
of a socialism of poverty, holding up its economic
success as proof of the success of its way of life and
in order to ensure the loyalty of its next generation.
But to society at large, the elevation of its standard
of living made it seem that the kibbutz was shedding its pioneering spirit and, internally, it made the
intellectual discourse sterile and created a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. The result was an impoverished socialism. If Marcuse was right in 1972 that
the kibbutz had “so far not turned bourgeois,” he
was not right for long.

A

ll of this raises the question of the character
of the third kibbutz generation. Its spokesmen
have claimed that they are not prepared to accept
the truths and norms of their parents, that they are
entitled to choose their own way of life just as their
parents once did. Does this attest to the success of
kibbutz education or its failure? A great deal of creative thinking, as well as financial and intellectual
investment, went into educating kibbutz children.
Ultimately, communal education produced kibbutz members who take naturally to physical labor, excel at team-work, and are prepared to work
hard. But it did not create a “new man” in the socialist sense, free of possessiveness, jealousy, and
personal ambition. Education and ideology proved
powerless against the influence of the surrounding
society and, perhaps, against human nature, which
turned out to be resistant to all attempts to redesign it. If the utopian project failed in the coercive
world of the USSR, it could hardly succeed in the
open, democratic society of Israel.
In the end, the fate of the kibbutz reminds us
that idealistic projects are always shaped by the
great events and movements of history. There are
indeed moments when it seems as if the human will
can change the course of history. But it is important
to remember that Zionism was realized not only
through the will of its champions and their sacrifices, but as the result of historical processes beyond
its control: two world wars, colonialism and decolonization, the Bolshevik Revolution, the Holocaust,

the Cold War, and other defining world events without which it is doubtful that any demonstration of
Zionist “will” or kibbutz idealism would ever have
prevailed. It was realized in an era in which states
fought for their very existence and nations stood on
the brink of the abyss. In this turbulent era, there
was room for worldviews that regarded the community and the nation as the bases of human existence,
and private life, comforts, and personal growth
as secondary to the needs of the group. However,
individual and general interests intersected only
in times of massive emergency. In the absence of
any such emergency over the past sixty years, new
winds have blown away old ideas and fashions. If
the Zionist idea had been born today, it would not

have caught on. Herzl’s “If you will it, it is no legend”
has symbolically evolved into current Tel Aviv graffiti featuring a picture of the founding father and the
words: “No will, no way.”
The same is true of the kibbutz. To be sure, the
economic collapse of the 1980s could have been
avoided. But it was impossible to prevent the decline in the kibbutz’s stature, both in the state and
in the eyes of the kibbutznik. The disappearance of
national-pioneering tasks had slowly dissolved any
sense of urgency; constant attrition and the inability
to attract new members had undermined self-confidence; and processes beyond the kibbutz movement’s control had produced enormous changes in
the public and social climate.

But the story of the kibbutz has not necessarily
reached its end. Although the movement has declined over the past sixty years, it has by no means
disappeared. Nor has it intellectual legacy been forgotten or rendered obsolete. One can readily imagine that Israel might, in the future, face the sort of
emergency that could revivify the kibbutz movement, or perhaps stimulate the creation of something new and different that will nevertheless draw
upon its heritage.

The Poet from Vilna
by Ruth R. Wisse

O

n the 6th of June, 1959, I arranged a rendezvous for the Yiddish poet Avrom
Sutzkever, who was then on his maiden
visit to North America. Unable to get a
visa for the United States, he had come on a speaking tour of several Canadian cities, spending most
of his time in Montreal, where I was living at the
time. Quite a number of his friends who had known
him before the war and writers who wanted to meet
him for the first time made the trip across the border, swelling the audiences for his public lectures
and readings. But the meeting I set up for him was
to be secret and private. On the agreed morning, my
husband Len and I drove Sutzkever to the Montreal airport where we picked up his visitor and then
took them both to a cottage we had booked at La
Chaumière, a secluded lodge in the foothills of the
Laurentian Mountains. Once we saw them settled,
we drove back to the city, returning the following
afternoon to execute the plan in reverse.
Sutzkever’s clandestine visitor was Max Weinreich, linguist and historian of the Yiddish language,
who had been his mentor in Vilna before 1939. The
two men had not seen one another in twenty years.
When the Germans invaded Poland, Weinreich
happened to be attending a conference in Denmark
with his elder son, Uriel. Father and son left for the
United States, where Max took time off from his
Yiddish scholarship to write Hitler’s Professors, documenting the participation of some of Germany’s
most distinguished thinkers in the Final Solution.
Meanwhile, Sutzkever and his new bride Freydke
had been incarcerated with some 80,000 fellow Jews
in the double ghetto that the Germans set up soon
after they occupied Vilna in the summer of 1941.
They were among the few who survived the massacres and deportations, reaching Moscow in March
1944, Paris (via Vilna and Lodz) in 1946, and Tel
Aviv in 1947.
“It is true that we deal in words, each of us in his
fashion,” Weinreich wrote to Sutzkever when they
established a correspondence after the war, “but it
doesn’t require words to express what we feel for one

another.” It was Weinreich who had asked that their
meeting be private so that they could spend their
short time together without fanfare or interruption.
Len and I had met Sutzkever two years earlier,
during our honeymoon in Israel, and I was now
shepherding him around Montreal, but I had not
met Max Weinreich before. The three of us waited
in the reception area, and when Weinreich emerged

Now, the seniority appeared to be reversed. For
one thing, Sutzkever had been there. Among my
parents’ friends I had noticed how those who had
survived the war in Europe were treated as valued
messengers from the beyond. “I saw Nadushka right
before the February roundup.” “Berl was still alive the
day the SS came to pick up Wittenberg.” “The child
was already skin and bones.” “Their farmer betrayed

his poems in the Vilna ghetto, had become a symbol of its
creative resistance.
from the swinging doors, Len and I hung back as
the two men greeted each other.
Their reunion was the most dramatic I was ever
to witness. No more than a long hug betrayed their
nervous joy, but I knew from the eagerness of some
of the letters and phone calls leading up to this moment how badly they wanted to be face to face.
Lithuanian Jews—as compared with their reputedly more warm-blooded and earthier Ukrainian,
Galician, and Polish kinfolk—are known for their
passionate reserve. Weinreich and Sutzkever never
switched from the formal to the intimate secondperson form of address. As Weinreich wrote in one
of his letters, they would always have “weightier
subjects” to talk about than their feelings.
Weinreich, nineteen years the elder, had founded
in Vilna the Jewish scouting movement Bin (Bee), in
whose magazine the nineteen-year-old Abrashe—as he
was then known to his intimates—published his first
poem, in 1932. Weinreich was also co-founding director of Vilna’s Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut (YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research), where Sutzkever came
in the late 1930s to pursue his interest in Old Yiddish
literature. When they had last seen one another, Sutzkever was transposing the early epic, Bove Bukh, into
modern Yiddish, and Weinreich was touting Vilna’s
talented emerging poet as one of the YIVO’s best fellowship students.

them.” In general, refugees occupy a lower social status than settled immigrants, but in this case the testimony of those who came to be known as survivors
often lent them authority that far exceeded that of
earlier arrivals. And Sutzkever was more than such
a witness. The young poet, who had continued writing and reading his poems in the Vilna ghetto, had
become a symbol of its creative resistance.
On the strength of his reputation, he and his
wife had been airlifted from occupied Poland to
Moscow, where he wrote In vilner geto, an itemized account of the horrors of the Final Solution in
Vilna. The Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg convinced
the Kremlin to have Sutzkever testify on behalf of
Russian Jewry at the Nuremberg Trials. A clip of
him refusing the court’s invitation to be seated is
available on YouTube. He delivers his testimony
standing at attention like the soldier he could not be
during the massacres he is describing. Of the aftermath of one roundup he says, “It looked as if a red
rain had fallen.”
As part of his work in the ghetto, Sutzkever had
organized the concealment of the most precious materials in the YIVO archives. After the war, he defied
Soviet prohibitions and arranged for their transfer to
Weinreich in New York. The student was now more
experienced than his instructor in what the world
had to teach.
